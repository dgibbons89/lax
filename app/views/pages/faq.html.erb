                        <p class="answer"> All the instructors were recruited by every school.  We know the process and still keep in close contact with many college coaches. We also know the skill level required for each level of play, whether it be college or high school.  Anything that we cannot answer (which is unlikely), we are one phone call away from talking to a head coach.  Lastly, we can guide your expectations on the process and expected outcome, saving you time and money. </p>
